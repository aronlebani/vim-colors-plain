# vim-colors-plain

Minimalist colour scheme using just bold to highlight keywords and a single colour for literals. It
works nicely with languages with minimalist syntax such as the lisp dialects.

## Motivation

This repository is forked from [vim-colors-plain](https://github.com/chrsm/vim-colors-plain), which
in turn is a fork of [vim-colors-off](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off/tree/main). I love
the [vim-colors-plain](https://github.com/chrsm/vim-colors-plain) colour scheme, but wanted to tweak
a few colours based on my own personal preference, so here we are.

## Installation & Usage

To install with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this line to your `.vimrc`:
```
Plug 'aronlebani/vim-colors-plain'
```
If you use a different plugin manager, consult the documentation for your plugin manager for more
information. Then to use the colour scheme, set:
```
set background=dark
colorscheme plain
```
